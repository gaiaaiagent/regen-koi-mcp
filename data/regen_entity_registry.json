      "description": "The Biodiversity Crediting Protocol for Umbrella Species Stewardship (USS) provides a comprehensive framework for measuring, verifying, and rewarding communities for their conservation of umbrella species—organisms whose protection benefits entire ecosystems and their inhabitants. The protocol measures conservation success through three integrated components: Umbrella Species Health, which tracks population dynamics and distribution; Habitat Quality, which assesses ecosystem composition and function; and a Theory of Change, which translates community knowledge and long-term goals into strategic conservation activities. By combining on-the-ground data collection, remote sensing, and traditional ecological knowledge, the protocol enables scientifically rigorous and transparent verification of conservation outcomes. All ecological data anchors securely to a blockchain, ensuring credible, verifiable proof of impact. The USS credits represent actual implementation costs, directly linking conservation finance to real biodiversity gains while preventing speculative trading. This empowers local communities and land stewards to address critical biodiversity threats and strengthens their essential role in long-term ecosystem stewardship."

Through an adaptive management approach, the project reduces nutrient loads via agricultural and watershed best management practices—including cover crops, conservation cover, grassed waterways, wetland restoration, and structural erosion control measures—thereby avoiding the need for a tertiary/advanced filtration upgrade at the Nine Springs Wastewater Treatment Plant. Project Proponents quantify reduction in GHG emissions associated with the avoided energy and materials from the gray infrastructure that green solutions replace, including construction materials, decades of operational energy use, and facility maintenance. Credits issue annually ex-post throughout the avoided infrastructure's lifetime."

One credit represents a composite measure of biodiversity stewardship effectiveness, focused on jaguars as an umbrella species, across a 40,613-hectare private conservation reserve, based on a Theory of Change established by ERA and IHP. The project combines advanced monitoring technologies with community engagement to address key threats, particularly wildfires which affected over 90% of the Serra do Amolar region in 2020."
